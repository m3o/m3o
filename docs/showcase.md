# Showcase

We want to provide a place where users can showcase apps built with m3o. 

The best apps will earn rewards. See [here](https://github.com/m3o/m3o/discussions/113) for more info 
or join #showcase on Discord.

## Getting Started

Build a web app using the M3O APIs. Host it using the [M3O Apps](https://m3o.com/app) service for 
free or a similar hosting provider. See [helloworld](https://github.com/m3o/helloworld) for an 
example. Once you've built the app, submit it in a PR here including a screenshot and we'll feature 
it on the website. That's it!
