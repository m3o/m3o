# M3O Services

M3O services provide the fundamental building blocks for any products, apps or services. They can be used in isolation 
or combined to create powerful distributed systems. The services are intended to be consumed by each other using RPC 
and externally through the M3O API.

## Interfaces

Every service starts with a protobuf interface definition, which is a standard used by Google and everyone else now that gRPC is so dominant. The idea is to define the API in protobuf, code generate and implement the handlers for it. The services can be called by other services on the platform using those code generated clients or an API Gateway, which M3O provides. External calls via the API use the same format but with HTTP/JSON endpoints.

## Usage

M3O Services depend on [Micro](https://github.com/micro/micro)

### Run Micro

Install and run the server first

```
micro server
```

### Run a Service

Run a service from source

```
micro run github.com/m3o/m3o/services/helloworld
```

### Call a Service

To call a service from another

```go
import "m3o.dev/services/helloworld/proto"
```

Call it through the API

```
curl "http://localhost:8080/helloworld/Call?name=Alice"
```

From the command line

```
micro helloworld call --name=Alice
```

Browse to

```
http://localhost:8082/helloworld/Call
```

## Hosting

M3O Services are hosted on [M3O](https://m3o.com) as serverless APIs

M3O converts protobuf to openapi specs and generates clients for the hosted services.

## Contribute

We welcome contributions of additional services:

- Services must be built using the M3O platform
- Any dependency must be configured using the M3O Config
- All services must include a README.md and be well commented

## Config

Config for each service should be stored under the service key by name

E.g db postgres host address `db.address`
