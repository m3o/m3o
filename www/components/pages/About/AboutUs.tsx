              In 2013 we worked at Hailo, a ride hailing startup in
              London, competing against Uber and pushing hard to scale our
              technology. It&apos;s there we cut our teeth on AWS and the cost
              of cloud complexity just to ship an app.

              Micro started life as an open source project to address some of
              those pains. That however only solved one half of the problem.
              It&apos;s not the development of cloud services that&apos;s
              difficult, but how they&apos;re consumed.

              M3O is a new cloud platform that focuses
              entirely on the developer experience. We&apos;re building an AWS
              alternative for the next generation of developers powered by Micro
